# All Tasks:

### Create a Task tracking web page, which will have a form where users can insert the data and click on the "Submit" button.
### Form Fields: Name, Date & Time, Task Status (Name, Date & Time, Task Status fields should have appropriate Data Validations)
### All 3 fields are mandatory and Form should have appropriate validation.
### When User submits the data, Data should be displayed in a Table below the Form.
### Tasks which have sub tasks & Start / Stop Time functionality
### Every task should have "Clone" functionality in which it will create the clone of task with sub tasks.
### Validate a sub task that the user can't remove it's Primary Task.
### The Table will have the same columns as the form (Name, Date & Time, Task Status, Action)
### Rightmost Column of Table will be Action which will have "Complete" "Edit" and "Delete" buttons on each row.
### Users should be able to Complete/Edit/Delete each entry using these buttons.
### Completed tasks should change to Green. Deleted Task Should turn into Red.


# Tasks that could not completed

### Edit tasks as passing data to modal was a little hard and when I tried to use, it won't reflect on modal form fields (removed the code).
### State change effect on sub task add (had to reload it).
### Start/stop timer time fetching/adding from/to database.
